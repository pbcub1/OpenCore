<h1>OpenCore</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>OpenCore is meant to be an open source social network. The vision of this is to create an open source platform for people to gather and enjoy talking with their friends and family, while being able to contribute to the back end. If you are looking for work to do on OpenCore, check the issues page, or try working on the milestones. Together we can create a beautiful experience. We want to see people coming together to engage in a whole assortment of activities. Check the road map under the contributing directory to see planned features.

	<h3>OpenCore is now open source!</h3>
	<h4>7/5/16</h4>
	<p>This website is now public for editing. I also decided on a name and vision for this website. An open source hub for people to engage in conversations, create posts, manage pictures, and other features in the future, all while being able to contribute to the very platform they are using. We don't want to force features on people, that's no fun for anyone. So we want to make sure we allow users to disable or otherwise dispute changes we make. We want to make it open for anyone able and willing to contribute to do so. We want to create one of the best user experiences that we can. Please refer to contributing wiki page for more information.</p>
